# Spartan rides

This application was done as a group project for Database Systems course. 

It is a ridesharing app that allows the student to register as a Rider or a Driver. Each user can create a scheduled ride and send request to rides scheduled by other users. Once user sends a request to a scheduled ride, the app sends a match request to the other party, and if the match was approved, the ride is created!
