# Multithreaded Sorting App

This application was a final project for Operating Systems course. I have created it to show how multithreading works in Apple's Grand Central Dispatch framework. 

User is given a choice to select the size of the randomly generated list of numbers and number of threads user would like to use for the sorting.

As the app is generating the list, starts the sorting process and generating threads, it keeps the user updated of which step is currently being executed and what is the exact number of threads are currently running (also denoted with emojis).
